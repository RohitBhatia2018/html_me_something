        <header>Adventure #1: Surfing in Costa Rica</header>
        </div>
    <p>
        I spent a week surfing in Tamarindo, Costa Rica.<br>
        This was my first solo trip.<br>
        Getting outside of my comfort zone and meeting new people was a great experience.<br>
        I also learned that surfing is really hard, but I did catch a couple big waves!<br>

    <header>Adventure #2: Skiing in Colorado</header>
    </div>
    <p>
        I spent 8 days skiing at Sunlight Mountain in Colorado with my friend Meg and her family / friends.<br>
        The highlights were getting a lot better at navigating moguls, learning a super fun card game called Squeak, and meeting some awesome people.<br>
